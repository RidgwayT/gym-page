<h1>Acting Career</h1>
    <p>Roussimoff branched out into acting again in the 1970s and 1980s, after a 1967 French boxing film, making his USA acting debut playing a Sasquatch ("Bigfoot") in a two-part episode aired in 1976 on the television series <i>The Six Million Dollar Man</i>. He appeared in other television shows, including <i>The Greatest American Hero</i>, <i>B. J. and the Bear</i>, <i>The Fall Guy</i> and 1990's <i>Zorro</i>.
    </p>
    <p>Towards the end of his career, Roussimoff starred in several films. He had an uncredited appearance in the 1984 film <i>Conan the Destroyer</i> as Dagoth, the resurrected horned giant god who is killed by Conan (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>). That same year, he also made an appearance in <i>Micki & Maude</i> (billed as André Rousimmoff). He appeared most notably as Fezzik, his own favorite role, in the 1987 film <i>The Princess Bride</i>. The fact that Roussimoff found that no one stared at him on set during production was a novel and particularly gratifying experience. Both the film and his performance retain a devoted following. In a short interview with Lanny Poffo, he stated that the movie meant so much to André that he made his wrestling pals watch an advanced copy of the VHS with him over and over again while supplying dinner, drinks, and sweetly asking each time, "Did you like my performance?".
    </p>
    <p>In his last film, he had a cameo role as a circus giant in the comedy <i>Trading Mom</i>, which was released in 1994, a year after his death.
