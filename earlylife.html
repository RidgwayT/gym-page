    <h1>Early Life</h1>
<p>André René Roussimoff was born on <time datetime="1946-05-19">19 May 1946</time> in Coulommiers, Seine-et-Marne, the son of immigrants Boris Roussimoff (1907–1993) and Mariann Roussimoff Stoeff (1910–1997); his father was Bulgarian and his mother was Polish. He had two older siblings and two younger. His childhood nickname was Dédé (/ˈdeɪdeɪ/, French: [dede]). At birth, André weighed 13 pounds (6 <abbr title="kilograms" aria-label="kilograms">kg</abbr>); as a child, he displayed symptoms of gigantism, and was noted as "a good head taller than other kids", with abnormally long hands. In a 1970s television interview, Roussimoff stated that his mother was 5 feet 2 inches tall and his father 6 feet 2 inches tall, and that according to his father his grandfather was 7 feet 8 inches tall. By the time he was 12, Roussimoff stood 191 <abbr title="centimeters" aria-label="centimeters">cm</abbr> (6 ft 3 <abbr title="inches" aria-label="inches">in</abbr>).
</p>
<p>Roussimoff was an average student, though good at mathematics. After finishing school at 14, as he did not think higher education was necessary for a farm laborer, he joined the workforce; contrary to popular legend, he did not drop out of school, as compulsory education in France at the time ended at 14.

<p>Roussimoff spent years working on his father's farm in Molien, where, according to his brother Jacques, he could perform the work of three men. He also completed an apprenticeship in woodworking, and next worked in a factory that manufactured engines for hay balers. None of these brought him any satisfaction. While Roussimoff was growing up in the 1950s, the Irish playwright Samuel Beckett was one of several adults who sometimes drove local children to school, including Roussimoff and his siblings. They had a surprising amount of common ground and bonded over their love of cricket, with Roussimoff recalling that the two rarely talked about anything else.
