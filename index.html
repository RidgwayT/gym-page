<h1>Andre the Giant</h1>
    <p>André René Roussimoff (French: [ɑ̃dʁe ʁəne ʁusimɔf]; 19 May 1946 – 27 January 1993), better known by his ring name <strong>André the Giant</strong>, was a French professional wrestler and actor. Roussimoff was known for his great size, which was a result of gigantism caused by excess growth hormone (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromegaly">acromegaly</a>). It also led to him being called "The Eighth Wonder of the World".
    </p>    
    <p>Beginning his career in 1966, Roussimoff relocated to North America in 1971. From 1973 to the mid-1980s, Roussimoff was booked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE">World Wide Wrestling Federation</a> (WWWF) promoter <a href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon">Vincent J. McMahon</a> as a roving "special attraction" who wrestled for promotions throughout the United States, as well as in Japan for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Japan_Pro-Wrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a>. During the 1980s wrestling boom, Roussimoff became a mainstay of the WWWF (by then renamed the World Wrestling Federation), being paired with the villainous manager <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Heenan">Bobby Heenan</a> and feuding with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan">Hulk Hogan</a>. The two headlined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania">WrestleMania III</a> in 1987, and in 1988, he defeated Hogan to win the WWF Championship, his sole world heavyweight championship, on the first episode of The Main Event. As his WWF career wound down after WrestleMania VI in 1990, Roussimoff wrestled primarily for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Japan_Pro_Wrestling">All Japan Pro-Wrestling</a>, usually alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Baba">Giant Baba</a>, until his sudden death.
    </p>  
    <p>After his death in 1993, Roussimoff became the inaugural inductee into the newly created WWF Hall of Fame. He was later a charter member of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame; the latter describes him as being "one of the most recognizable figures in the world both as a professional wrestler and as a pop culture icon." Outside of wrestling, Roussimoff is best known for appearing as Fezzik, the giant in the 1987 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_(film)"><i>The Princess Bride</i></a>.
